We have a image file named `hex_editor.jpg`. The name seemed to be a hint, so I opened the image with a hex editor (I used `bless`), and searched for the string `pico`. At the bottom of the file, the editor found this string: `Your flag is: "picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_dF817ec5}"`.

Flag: `picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_dF817ec5}`
